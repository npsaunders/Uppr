**<h1 align="center"> Uppr</h1>**

### This app allows the user to create/edit/view/delete practice interview questions. With these questions, the user can then go to a page to practice answering the questions.

### **Background:**

We have been learning various languages over the last 3 months. We're doing a lot of reps, of entering code into the computer, to help us learn. We also need to practice answering questions to prepare for interviews. It would be a shame to get an interview and then have it go badily due to lack of preperation. That is where Uppr will give you an upper hand in interviews.

### **Getting Started**
You can do a practice exercise without logging in/creating a user. For additional functionality (creating questions/profile), you need to sign up.
